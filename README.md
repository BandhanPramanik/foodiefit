## Development Stack

Static branch: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
Flask branch (will be the actual version): Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, Flask (for making the website scalable), SQLite (for managing the databases)

## Points kept in mind

- The colours and their contrast ratios are in accordance with the WCAG AAA accessibility standards.
- The background is not fully white - it has a brownish shade to it.
- The website is fully accessible from a mobile phone.

## Future plans

- Will have to make any app development in the future scalable, so that changes in the website are reflected on the app.
- Will have to make the other pages along with the About Me page.
- Will have to make the coding process easier, while ensuring BLAZING performance.
